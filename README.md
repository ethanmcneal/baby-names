### How will version 0.1 look?

#### First release to have US, England, Wales, and possibly some other countries.

#### Using Bottom tab navigation. no sign up. just hop right in and start swiping! made as simple and intuitive as possible for ease of use. 

#### No DB, data is stored locally as JSON. no plans to change this as it is much faster and simpler for the user, no internet required to use.

### PLANS FOR FUTURE RELEASES: 

1. add "Templates" to change style of cards, right now they are color coded by gender and look like a sticky note. 
Some ideas for templates include: 
 - Chalk Board/white board, depending if in dark mode or light mode.
 - School assignment,
  - "Hi My Name Is:" name-tag,

2. more data for each name, ex: origin, meaning, ect
- this will be tedious but will overall make the app much better. one of the top items on my list.
